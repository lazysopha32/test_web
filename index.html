    <p2> Technically already starting on this log since past 12am, but technically it counts as the next day. :/ Things have been pretty aight these days and this website right here kinda makes me happy. Hopefully
    over time I'll be able to turn this into something more and have something to look back at further along my path of coding. Right now it's still quite difficult to grasp new concepts and commands. The idea of git is starting
  to become clearer and getting used to commiting and pushing to a remote repository has been slightly irritating. I will begin another related course to html languages and more with a required 300 hours for the whole thing
and projects. q-q Commitment will haunt me like a bitch with this one but I think im determined enough this time(then again I said the same thing with art). Anyways I should probably head to sleep for a bit and continue this later...</p2><br>
